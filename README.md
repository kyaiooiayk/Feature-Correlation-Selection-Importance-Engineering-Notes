# Feature Correlation/Selection/Importance and Engineering
*List of notebooks focused on feature selection, feature importance and feature engineering*
***

## What is what?
- Features correlation
- Features selection
- Features importance
- Feature engineering
***

## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black& white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured.
